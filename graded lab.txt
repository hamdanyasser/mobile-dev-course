Build an Android app that allows the user to manage a list of their favorite books. The app should enable adding new books via a form screen, choosing genre from a Spinner, and showing the list in a ListView. On clicking a book, the user should be able to share it WhatsApp (implicit intent).

App Components & Requirements:
1. MainActivity.java
Contains a ListView showing the list of favorite books (Book Title + Genre).

A FloatingActionButton (FAB) opens a new screen to add a book (via explicit intent).

On return from the add screen, the new book is added to the ListView.

2. AddBookActivity.java / AddBookActivity.kt
Form screen with:

EditText for Book Title

Spinner for Genre (e.g., Novel, Biography, Science, Other)

Button to submit

On submit, the book info is passed back using activity result. (Make sure that book title and genre are not empty , otherwise display a toast message to the user to fill before submit )

3. Book Click Behavior (ListView item click)
On clicking a book in the list, the app sends an implicit intent to:

Open WhatsApp with pre-filled subject and body to share the book to the number 76867167:

Subject: “Check out this book”

Body: “You should read [Book Title] – it’s a great [Genre]!”

Note: you have to use strings.xml for the titles , in addition to using colors.xml for the palleted colors you will use.
